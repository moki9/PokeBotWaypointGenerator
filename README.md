## Use
Using the route generator is as easy as clicking on map. The map can be zoomed in and out and dragged to the location of your choice.

To setup a route for your bot first move and center the map over your location or the location you would like to use. Now select the starting point for your route. A marker will be placed at the selected point on the map with the label **A**.
